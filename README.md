tobamsShopper
=========

## development
I started with designing the model for the dummy data, and other types/interfaces, to follow OOP principles, and moved onto the UI components, as it gives flexibility for new UI features. The screens were next, along with their supporting sdks. 

## How to run the app

From the main directory, run (npm start) to start metro, then toggle (a) to run android, and toggle (i) to run on ios.
